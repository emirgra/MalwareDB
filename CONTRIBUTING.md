Zip samples into zip archive with password "infected", rename samples from .exe, .dll, .elf, .dmg, .deb, .ocx, .scr, .bat, .vbs, .js, etc to .<extension>.vir

Just fork that repository, upload samples.
After that create push request and into a description write families names.

Or you can send samples to my mail: koffidev365supp@gmail.com
